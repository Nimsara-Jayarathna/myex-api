# Blipzo API v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview
- **Version:** v1.0.0
- **Release Date:** 2026-01-01
- **Summary:** This is the initial stable release of the Blipzo API. It provides a robust, RESTful backend service for managing personal finances, including user authentication, category management, transaction tracking, and spending insights. This release introduces a modular `src/` architecture, API versioning (v1), and comprehensive logging.

## Features
### Authentication & User Management
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with Access and Refresh token rotation.
- **Profile Management**: Endpoints to retrieve and manage user profiles.
- **Security**: Password hashing using bcrypt, HttpOnly cookies for token storage, and device/IP tracking on login.

### Financial Management
- **Categories**: Create, update, and delete income/expense categories. Includes support for spending limits, default values, and soft-archiving.
- **Transactions**: Full CRUD support for transactions with custom dates, statuses, and optional notes.
- **Analytics**: Built-in support for summarizing transactions by week, month, or year (via query parameters).

### Core Infrastructure
- **API Versioning**: All endpoints are namespaced under `/api/v1` for future-proofing.
- **Health Checks**: Dedicated `/health` endpoint for monitoring uptime and status.
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Unified middleware for consistent error responses.
- **Enhanced Logging**: structured logging for requests, including execution time, client IP, device type, and OS.

## Bug Fixes
- **Connection Stability**: Resolved intermittent "Network Error" issues affecting the `/health` endpoint and other routes.
- **Middleware Ordering**: Fixed issues with middleware placement that caused request context loss.

## Improvements / Refactors
- **Directory Structure Refactor**: Migrated codebase to a cleaner `src/` directory layout:
  - `src/api/v1/`: Contains all versioned controllers and routes.
  - `src/config/`: Database and environment configuration.
  - `src/middleware/`: Auth and error handling middleware.
  - `src/services/` (Planned/In-Progress): Separation of business logic from controllers.
- **Global API Versioning**: Standardized all API routes to use the `/api/v1/` prefix.
- **Logging Upgrade**: Implemented `morgan` with custom tokens and a custom logger utility for detailed request auditing.

## Known Limitations
- **Service Layer Migration**: Refactoring controllers to a dedicated service layer is partially complete/ongoing.
- **Rate Limiting**: currently relying on basic server protection; dedicated rate limiting middleware is planned for v1.1.

## Setup / Run Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- MongoDB

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
3. Configure environment variables in `.env` (refer to `README.md` for template).

### Running the App
- **Development**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Production**:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- **Testing**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## Branching & Versioning Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code. Deployed to production environment.
- **dev**: Active development branch. Deployed to staging for internal testing.
- **Feature Branches**: Created from `dev` for specific tasks (e.g., `feature/user-auth`, `fix/login-bug`). Merged back into `dev` via Pull Request.
- **Versioning**: Follows Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

## Notes
- **Deployment**: Integrated with GitHub Actions for automated deployment to staging (on push to `dev`) and production (on push to `main`).
- **CORS**: Configurable via `CLIENT_ORIGIN` environment variable to support secure cross-origin requests.
